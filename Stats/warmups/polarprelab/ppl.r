#Question 1.
plot(isoT$delta18O, isoT$temperature)
# The plot exhibits some approximately linear behavior (positive relationship), although there is a potential slight bend upwards and an outlier.


# There is a clear outlier, although it is hard to determine that it is a bad datapoint since it is within the range of data. 

subset(isoT, X==82) # the outlier, at y=-5.4 degrees.
# in the temperature_corrected column, there is an entry of -55.4,rEV5TX5kRSjAï»¿
# it appears that the user forgot to type a 5.

# We confirm this,
subset(isoT, X > 78 & X < 86)$temperature
# we see that indeed -55.4 is in line with all of the surrounding X values, so this corrected mistake appears to be appropriate

#for readibility, set temp column to temperature_corrected

######### fit data as is############

#diagnostic plots

# We see that the data here is centered around 0, however there appears to be 
# a pattern in the residuals for lower values, with increased spread

# Slight left skew in the residual histogram

#QQ plot here has long tails on the edges. This data should need a transformation

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(y, breaks=20, main="Histogram of Temperature Values", xlab="Temperature")
hist(x, breaks=20, main="Histogram of delta18O Values", xlab="delta18O")
# it seems that there are higher frequencies of datapoints at the extremes, we can try some transformations, possibly a square root transform

hist(sqrt(-y), breaks=20) # we see extremes here still at the edge, but this looks mostly uniform.
hist(log(-y), breaks=20) # a log transform looks worse.
hist(1/y, breaks=20) # now we have consistent concave up, maybe now a transform?
hist(log(-1/y), breaks=20) # this does not seem any better than sqrt(-y), and given the added complexity of the transformation it seems not worth it.



hist(sqrt(-x), breaks=20) # this data is still bimodal.
hist(log(-x), breaks=20) # a log transform looks worse, again.
hist(1/x, breaks=20) # now we have consistent concave up, maybe now a transform?
hist(log(-1/x), breaks=20) # this seems worse again.
# it seems no transformation of x is fully satisfactory. We will try square roots since the best transformations came from those

######### try square root transforms data as is############

#diagnostic plots
# We see that the data here is centered around 0, however there appears to be 
# a pattern in the residuals for lower values, with increased spread. The residuals look less normal and more skewed.
############### not too helpful. clearly, this plot is no better ###############




##### The bimodal nature of the data is responsible for the difficulty in transformation. Last idea to obtain a normal distribution is boxcox, although it will obfuscate meaning.####

px <- -x
py <- -y
# box cox transform
bc <- boxcox(py ~ px)
lambda <- (bc$x)[which.max(bc$y)]
#fit new linear regression model using the Box-Cox transformation
ty <- ((py^lambda-1)/lambda)
plot(ty ~ px)
bcmodel <- lm(ty ~ px)
abline(bcmodel)

#evaluate fit
plot(bcmodel$fitted, bcmodel$resid)
# Here the data is scattered much better in the plot, although there is some clumping around the fitted values of 100.
hist(bcmodel$resid)
# 
# Slight left skew in the residuals
qqnorm(bcmodel$resid)
qqline(bcmodel$resid)
# This is the best fit, but we have a loss of understanding here.

iceCore$predictedTemp <- predict(slr, data.frame(delta18O=iceCore$d18O))

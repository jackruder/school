\subsection*{a}%
\label{sub:a}
Response is the Final exam score. Explanatory is the font used.
\subsection*{b}%
\label{sub:b}
This is a randomized experiment, since fonts were assigned at random, by the teacher.
\subsection*{c}%
\label{sub:c}
The students in the class were not cherry-picked for the experiment, so an analysis of covariance should be fine.

\section*{5.17}%
\label{sec:5.17}
\subsection*{a}
The units in this experiment are the students.
\subsection*{b}%
\label{sub:b}
The treatment is which font is assigned.
\subsection*{c}%
Each of the 40 fonts should be assigned to the same number of students.

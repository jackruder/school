\section*{7.19}%
\label{sec:7.19}
Comparison, Replication, Crossing and Randomization are all met, but there is not any blocking.

\section*{7.21}
Here, we observe that there is a pronounced interaction between the fortifications, with a change in means. We also see that there is a possibly smaller standard deviation in cases with ZnLow, suggesting a transformation should be explored. 

\section*{7.23}%
\label{sec:7.23}
Yes the plot shows that there is an interaction.

\section*{7.27}

\subsection*{a}
Firstly, there is no randomization within Male/Female servers, since there is only 1 of each. This is a problem because only the assignment  of smiley faces is randomized; the experiment should be dependent on random assignment of a Male/Female server.

\subsection*{b}
 One degree of freedom for Male/Female, 0 for the differences between servers, and 0 for the interaction.

 \subsection*{c}%
 \label{sub:c}
If we are to do a Two-Way analysis there needs to be multiple Male/Female servers to explain unit to unit block variation. The analysis incorrectly assumes this variation which cannot exist with a single server.

\subsection*{d}
For each of the 6 servers, make six groups of tables. For each server, randomly assign smiley faces to half of their tables, and record the resulting tips.

I believe all of these variables affect sale price, although
I expect a large amount of collinearity to be present in
some of the variables (i.e. zipcode, latitude, longitude). 

Some of the variables of course will be less useful than 
others, but there really aren't any here that stand out as
not important.

This model would be useful to homebuyers, in knowing if 
a home is appropriately priced. This model would also be
useful for rennovators/builders, to know where to put in
effort to maximize value.
